            New to Connect 4? Wondering what it is?
            Connect 4 is a 2 player game that was invented
            in the 1970’s.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

            It got wildly popular all throughout the 1980’s
            AND to date.
            In the game, the players take turns inserting colored
            markers/discs into a rack.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
            Psst. Did you know it is said that the first person to
            play can always win if they know the right moves.
            Just sayin´ ;)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
            Or maybe read some more about the rules?

        First, decide who goes first.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Only one player at the time will be able to play.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        On your turn, drop one of your colored markers into
        the rack by clicking in the column you want to put
        your marker in. (the marker will end up in the first
        free position in that column).
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row (horizontal,
        vertical or diagonal) or if there´s a stalemate.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The starter of the previous game goes second on the
        next game.
